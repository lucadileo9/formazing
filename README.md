A clear and linear guide to managing training sessions in 3 clicks, without stress and without errors.

---

## What is this app and why it exists

### The problem it solves

"I need to schedule training sessions for the association, but every time I waste time creating Teams meetings, sending emails, remembering codes, and managing feedback. What if I make a mistake in the communications? Total panic."

### The solution

An app as simple as a button that:

* **Does nothing on its own** - only you decide when to act.
* **Uses Notion as a database** (you enter the data, the app transforms it).
* **Blocks errors** (no accidental sends, no broken links).

**Keyword: Total Control. You command, the app obeys.**

---

## General Architecture

### 1. Notion = Your shared Excel sheet

**What it contains:** Only the raw data of the training sessions (Name, Area, Date...).

**What it DOES NOT contain:** Complex formulas, automations, or calculated codes.

#### Database structure (mandatory fields):

| Field | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Web Security | Title of the training |
| **Area** | IT | Dropdown: IT, R&D, HR, Legal, Commercial, Marketing, All |
| **Date/Time** | 03/15/2024 14:00 | Confirmed date and time |
| **Period** | SPRING | Dropdown: SPRING, AUTUMN, ONCE, EXT, OUT |
| **Status** | Planned | Only 3 options: Planned, Scheduled, Completed |
| **Code** | (empty) | The app fills this at the right time |
| **Teams Link** | (empty) | The app fills this at the right time |

#### Period Types:

* **SPRING/AUTUMN**: Periodic training sessions (Spring/Autumn).
* **ONCE**: Internal one-off training sessions.
* **EXT**: Training received from external sources (other JEs, companies, professors).
* **OUT**: Training provided externally (for other JEs or the university).

---

## Complete Operational Flow

### Phase 1: Create the training in Notion (you, in peace)

1. Open the "Trainings" Notion database.
2. Click "New page".
3. Fill in only these fields:
* **Name** -> Web Security
* **Area** -> IT
* **Date/Time** -> 03/15/2024 14:00
* **Period** -> SPRING
* **Status** -> Planned (mandatory!)


4. Do not touch other fields (Code, Teams Link remain empty).
5. Save -> the training is ready to be sent.

**Why it is safe:**

* No automatic sending.
* You can modify data as long as the status is "Planned".

### Phase 2: Send communications (1 click in the app, with mandatory preview)

1. **Open the Flask app** and log in with your password (Basic Auth protection).
2. **See ONLY the training sessions** with status = "Planned".
3. **Select the training** and click "Preview communications".
4. **See exactly** what will be sent and to whom:

#### Preview example:

```
EMAIL (sent to: IT team)
Subject: [IT] "Web Security" Training on 03/15 - Code: IT-Web_Security-2024-SPRING-01

TELEGRAM (group: IT + MAIN)
Message: New training for IT!
Topic: Web Security
Date: 03/15/2024 14:00

```

5. **If everything is OK**, click "CONFIRM SEND".

The app performs **5 things in sequence:**

1. Generates the code -> `IT-Web_Security-2024-SPRING-01`
2. Creates the Teams meeting -> link saved in Notion.
3. Sends emails to the involved areas, including the Teams link.
4. Sends Telegram messages to the involved groups (area group + main group), including the Teams link.
5. Updates the status -> "Scheduled".

### Phase 3: Send feedback (1 click in the app, after the training)

1. **Open the Flask app** -> go to "Trainings to close".
2. **See ONLY the training sessions** with status = "Scheduled".
3. **Click "SEND FEEDBACK"**.

The app performs **3 things:**

1. Searches for the pre-filled link in `feedback_links.csv`.
2. Sends the link via Telegram to the involved groups.
3. Updates the status -> "Completed".

---

## 3-Step Flow Summary

1. **In Notion:** You fill in the basic data -> Status = "Planned".
2. **In the App:** You click "Send communications" -> the app generates the code, creates Teams, sends email/Telegram after preview.
3. **After the Training:** You click "Send feedback" -> the app sends the link via Telegram and updates status to "Completed".

**No hidden complexity. No risk. Only 2 clicks per month.**

## Security Guarantees

| Scenario | App Solution | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "I'm afraid of sending by mistake" | Password + mandatory preview + explicit confirmation | No accidental sending |
| "I don't want to manage complex codes" | The app generates the code on click | Zero human error |
| "How do I manage feedback links?" | Separate script generates links offline | Links always ready |
| "A colleague could ruin everything" | Basic Auth + no automatic actions | Only you can send |
| "I want to know today's sessions" | Telegram bot with commands | Info always at your fingertips |
